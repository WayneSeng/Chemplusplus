## Bohr Diagram

When you call for a bohr diagram from the application it will create a new window with the diagram along with the following information:

1. The charge
2. The number of electrons

## Unit Conversion

When you call the unit conversion button a new window will pop up. The element you put into the original box will be used for calculations as each elemnts has a different grams to mole ratio. At the time of writing this only one input field can have information i.e. 5 mols of Helium or 10g of Hydrogen. There is a clear button in the bottom right which automatically clears the boxes for ease of access. There is also an enter button. When this is pressed it will automatically fill the remaining boxes with their according values.

## Search Bar

The search bar eliminates the need for the user to open a browser. Whatever is entered into the input will be sent to the chemistry stack exchange. It will take the top 3 results and display them in a new window. There are forward and backward buttons which can be pressed in the top left of this new window, these allow you to shift between the answers. We are working on formatting the results.

## Equation Balancer

The equation balancer eliminates the need to do complex calculations. By simply entering your unbalanced equation and clicking on get balance, your balanced equation will be returned to you in milliseconds!

## Compound Diagram

No need to open an browser. After entering a compound name, clicking on get struct, your entry will be searched on the pubchem database. In a few seconds, your compound diagram will be returned back to you.

## Significant Figures

Ever wondering how to write a number in 4 sf? No need to worry anymore! By simply entering your number into the enter equation field, the sf into the places field, and clicking on get result, the answer will instantly appear in the enter equation field.

## Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is sometimes hard to understand. By simply entering a number and clicking on get sci notation, you will instantly know how to write a number in scientific notation.
